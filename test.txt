                    THE CYBER _and_ JUSTICE HOLMES

                            BY FRANK RILEY

             _Old Judge Anderson feared the inevitable--he
             was to be replaced by a Cyber! A machine that
             dealt out decisions free of human errors and
              emotions. What would Justice Holmes think?_

"Cyber justice!" That's what the District Attorney had called it in his
campaign speech last night.

"Cyber justice!"

Oh, hell!

Judge Walhfred Anderson threw the morning fax paper on top of the law
books he had been researching for the past two hours, and stomped
angrily across his chamber to the door of the courtroom.

But it was easier to throw away the paper than the image of the words:

"--and, if re-elected, I pledge to do all in my power to help replace
human inefficiency with Cyber justice in the courts of this county!

"We've seen what other counties have done with Cyber judges. We've
witnessed the effectiveness of cybernetic units in our own Appellate
Division.... And I can promise you twice as many prosecutions at half
the cost to the taxpayers ... with modern, streamlined Cyber justice!"

Oh, hell!


Professor Neustadt turned to Judge Anderson, and his voice dropped
almost to a whisper.

"Your Honor, I move that this case be dismissed."

The worn handle of his old teakwood gavel felt warm and alive to the
Judge's fingers. He sat up straight, and banged resoundingly on the top
of his desk.

"Case dismissed."

Then, in full view of the cameras, Walhfred Anderson turned and winked
boldly at Oliver Wendell Holmes.
